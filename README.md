# Jekyll Dark Portfolio (Slate Theme)

A minimal dark portfolio using **GitHub Pages + Jekyll** with the official **Slate** theme.

## Quick Start
1. Create a new repo named `USERNAME.github.io` (or any repo name for a project site).
2. Upload these files to the root of the repo and commit.
3. If it's a project site, go to **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main / root**.
4. Your site will publish shortly at `https://USERNAME.github.io` (or `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME`).

## Custom Domain
- In **Settings → Pages**, set your custom domain and save — this will create/update a `CNAME` file automatically.
- In your DNS, point `www` as a **CNAME** to `USERNAME.github.io`.

## Customize
- Edit `_config.yml` for title/description.
- Edit `index.md`, add more pages in `projects/` and link them.
- Replace the YouTube `VIDEO_ID` with your reel.
